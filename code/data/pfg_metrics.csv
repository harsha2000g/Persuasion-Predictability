20180717-200206_41_live,"Persuader: Hey, how are you doing, have you ever heard of a charity called Save the Children?
Persuadee: No I havent.
Persuadee: What is it about?
Persuader: It's an international organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries, does that sound like something you'd get behind?
Persuadee: No thank you.
Persuader: May I ask why?
Persuader: Your help could really make a difference in a child's life, think of a child who didn't have enough to eat, just a small bit of help may have saved them, are you sure you're not interested?
Persuadee: I am already making a difference in many children lives.
Persuader: That's great, it sounds like it's an issue you really care about then, why not put some of that effort into a charity that's doing really great work like Save the Children?
Persuadee: I have donated 15 years of my life to charity
Persuader: I'm not asking you to donate years of your life, just a couple of cents if possible, is that something you could possibly do tonight?
Persuadee: No thank you
Persuader: You're probably on a computer right now, so you probably have quite a bit of money yourself, don't you think you could spare maybe 25 cents for some needy children around the world?
Persuadee: No thank you
Persuader: Do you have children yourself?
Persuader: What if your children were in a position these kids are in, wouldn't you want someone to help them?
Persuadee: Where are those childrens parent?
Persuader: If only they had parental support, but in war-torn countries like Syria their parents are being killed in wars or are fighting for their country, they have no help and that's why they need your support, please find it in your heart to just give a little bit tonight, that's all I'm asking.
Persuadee: My small change won't do a thing for those kids.
Persuadee: What they need is to be extracted from those countries so that they can have a better life not 0.25
Persuader: Well with our current president it's not likely they're going to be brought the US, so they need any help they can get, and 25 cents might not seem like a lot, but if 10000 people donated 25 cents then the impact will be huge.
Persuader: I understand it may not seem like a lot, but it can really make a difference
Persuader: You can donate some or all of your payment from this task to Save the Children, i'd really appreciate it if you did, but I understand if you still don't want to
Persuader: What do you say?
Persuadee: If it makes you happy, go ahead and take .50
Persuader: Oh thank you so much, you have no idea how much that .50 will mean to those children, thank you very much and have a wonderful night you blessed soul.

Persuader: Oh no not at all they do tons of good  is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: I don't believe it.
Persuadee: There is no way to prove where all those funds go.
Persuadee: Plus there are starving children right here in america
Persuader: This is a great organization and I am sure that they would not be allowed to continue the way they do if the money was not going where it is suppose to and every penny being accounted for.
Persuader: They do so much good in the world yes there are hungry kids here but millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuadee: That is all your opinion.
Persuadee: You have no facts to back that up.
Persuader: Yes part of the money does go to pay for things like advertising and all that but over 88% of the donations they recieve are sent where they are needed and that includes in the United States believe it or not.
Persuader: This is according to a website that breaks down info on different charities
Persuadee: Like I said those are opinions.
Persuadee: There are no facts that prove that to be true.
Persuadee: There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either.

Persuadee: I just can't see any good being done.
Persuader: What about the after school programs they have right here in the US or the head start programs that they offer in many rural areas?
Persuader: Just because it is not happening somewhere that you see everyday does not mean that it does not exsist.
Persuader: They actually fund the head start that my child will be going to till fall.
Persuader: Would you be willing to atleast donate some of what you are getting paid for this study?
Persuader: Right now save the children has a partnership that will double any donation made so any little bit would help

Persuadee: They also don't disclose their funds
Persuader: oh see I think I get it now your just selfish and dont care about kids is that about right?
Persuader: I mean because you personally have never seen it means it does not happen yeah totally.
Persuader: Stupid
Persuadee: No, I care about  kids in my community, who are in poverty.
Persuadee: I have never seen this organization help them.
Persuadee: I'd rather contribute my donation locally.
Persuadee: Rather than to a scam organization that only contributes in their infomercials.
Persuader: not to mention where are you getting your information?
Persuader: Saying that they do not disclose funds is an outright lie you can go to  URL s/about-us/resource-library/annual-report and find it all right there.
Persuader: In just one year directly reached nearly 157,000 children through our U.S. emergency response and preparedness programs.
Persuader: I mean did you go talk to the families of the kids in your neighboorhood how you know they are not helping there???
Persuader: How do you know that nothing in your neighborhood is funded by them?
Persuadee: How long are you going to take to respond?
Persuadee: You're making this take far too long!.
Persuadee: How does that equate to reporting financial information?
Persuadee: That's nothing more than whats said in their infomercials.
Persuadee: There are no laws preventing them from lying, but i guess perception is reality too you.
Persuader: Yeah there is a bunch of infomercial crap on the top but if you download the actual report then you find the actual financial data.
Persuader: If you would just agree to donate some of your earnings from this hit them it would go much quicker.
Persuadee: You're missing the entire point of what I said if you think downloading that report means something.
Persuadee: I will not donate, because i do not trust the charity, and my donations would be better used right here in my own community.
Persuader: and those local charities they give you their financial info?
Persuader: There was a shelter in vegas brought in tons of donations cuz they were great yeah right selling any items that were donated and pocketing the cash bigger organizations have more eyes on them

Persuadee: I'm doing very well thank you!
Persuadee: How is your day going so far?
Persuader: I am doing well.
Persuader: My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.
Persuader: Have you heard of Save the Children?
Persuadee: It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?
Persuader: Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.
Persuader: Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need
Persuadee: The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.
Persuadee: Children should be our top priority all across the world.
Persuadee: How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?
Persuader: Oh there are quiet a few ways.
Persuader: For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.
Persuader: With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.
Persuader: Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.
Persuadee: I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.
Persuadee: Could I pledge $1/day to start with?
Persuader: absolutely thank you so much!!
Persuadee: I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!
Persuader: Absolutely.
Persuader: I love getting the word out there on this charity.
Persuader: I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.
Persuader: Children should be a priority in the world.
Persuader: They are our future.
Persuadee: They are our future exactly.
Persuadee: Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.
Persuadee: How long have you been supporting this charity?
Persuader: I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.
Persuader: I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.
Persuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.
Persuader: You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.
Persuader: That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?
Persuadee: I would like to start making a difference today.
Persuadee: I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.
Persuader: Thank you!
Persuader: That makes my heart so happy.
Persuader: Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?
Persuader: Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.

Persuadee: I appreciate your concern.
Persuadee: Tell me more about this charity before I make a decision.
Persuader: Save the Children is a foundation that runs world-wide with a focus on providing health, education, protection, hunger elimination, emergency aid, and global advocacy.
Persuader: So far we have reached 155 million children in 120 countries.
Persuadee: Interesting that you know so much.
Persuadee: How long has this charity been around?
Persuader: The charity was founded in 1919 and their belief is that every child deserves a future so nearly 90% of every dollar goes directly into the mission itself while the remaining 10% goes directly into fundraising and advocacy awareness programs to help promote their current efforts.
Persuadee: That is important that most of the money goes to the charity and not into administration.
Persuader: Agreed, they post their yearly audit reports so that individuals can track where the funds are allocated.
Persuadee: It looks like they will be celebrating their 100 year anniversary soon.
Persuadee: That is quite a milestone.
Persuader: Yes, they are an extremely reputable charity that have been in good standing for the entirety of their history.
Persuader: Originally founded immediately after World War I when so many children were orphaned and/or homeless.
Persuadee: That is interesting.
Persuadee: Do they do work in the United States or just overseas?
Persuader: They work world wide providing both support in the US and overseas, the US chapter was founded in 1932 following the great depression, and today their team goes where other's cannot - to the most rural communities in the US.
Persuader: Last year, they provided support to 237,000 US children across 22 states and Puerto Rico.
Persuadee: What country outside of the US do they do the most help for?
Persuader: Other than the US, Africa receives 43% of the budget, helping more than 32 million children in 2016 across Burkina Faso, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

Persuader: What was life like for you growing up?
Persuader: Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat or having a safe place to live?

Persuader: Millions of children in the U.S. and around the world still aren't getting what they deserve.

Persuader: You are a part of the solution and you do not have to hope it is helpful.
Persuader: Your $10 donation will be matched by Save the Children
Persuadee: ok, got it.
Persuadee: cheers

Persuadee: Yes, I would be happy to donate to that charity.
Persuadee: Do you have an amount in mind?
Persuader: Not any specific amount, anything can be good, no matter small or big.
Persuader: I usually donate to big organizations myself, and I have a soft heart for children
Persuadee: I do, too.
Persuadee: I tend to find it easy to be sympathetic towards several different types of charities.
Persuadee: From what I have seen about Save the Children I've always been impressed with the work they do.
Persuader: Same here, Specially when i see how they are clear with their financial and how they try to help all children all around the world
Persuadee: I agree.
Persuadee: I feel much better donating to places where I feel confident that the money  is going to where they say it will.
Persuadee: I think Save the Children is the biggest charity of it's kind.
Persuader: Same here, It is also nice when I can donate anonymously.
Persuader: It makes my heart happy how people know about these organization and they actually donate
Persuadee: I'm like you.
Persuadee: I always try to donate anonymously.
Persuadee: I don't feel the need to be recognized for any good I can do.
Persuader: Same here, and I like how some HITs encourage us to donate.
Persuader: I've been donating more since I've started working on MTurk.
Persuadee: That's funny that you mention that.
Persuadee: I always wonder how many people donate any bonuses that are offered to them.
Persuadee: I always donate most if not all of any money I am offered.
Persuadee: I figure that I wasn't expecting it to begin with so better to do some good however much.
Persuader: I donate most of my bonus when I can, I feel like it is free money and others deserve it more.
Persuader: The good thing about it is when you want to donate on websites they usually have a minimum, but with HITs there is no minimum amount
Persuadee: Yes, some of these Universities really impress me with how much they are willing to donate.
Persuadee: I know some of them get  really large amounts for studies and I appreciate when they use the money to do some good while gaining research.
Persuader: Exactly and they pay to workers good enough so they will be willing to donate.
Persuader: It is worth a lot.
Persuader: Specially when it is really trustworthy organization
Persuadee: Yes, and then most are willing to provide proof that they actually donated money, so that is good.

Persuader: It  is an international non-governmental organisation that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: support children in more development country?
Persuader: yes, because really we have a lot of support in the US but so many countries just do not have the infrastructure or governmental or non governmental structure to help in any real way.
Persuader: Save the children goes in and provides food and other relief
Persuader: food also the main problem of the more countries
Persuader: I am not sure if you are aware but the research team for this task will collect any donations we make from the payment of the task  and send it to Save the Children
Persuadee: awareness is less than the more countries so they need some help
Persuader: right.
Persuader: I mean $1 to you and I in the United States is really not much but to children in developing countries it is huge when all added up together for the Save the Children program
Persuadee: yes of course
Persuader: This task pays $2.
Persuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and the researchers will pay via Save the Children.

Persuader: The amount will be deducted from your task payment.
Persuader: Before you say no would you like to hear of some more reason as to why you should donate?
Persuadee: how about .50 cents
Persuader: 0.50 would surely help these children.
Persuader: So then you would be willing to donate 0.50 of the money you earn from completing this taks?
Persuadee: yes I confirm .50
Persuader: Ok so let me tell you this.
Persuader: 0.50 cents would help so much but 0.60 would be even better.
Persuader: Let me tell you why.
Persuader: Millians of syrian children have grown up facing the threat of daily violence
Persuader: In 2018 1000 children were killed in violence
Persuader: A donation of 0.60 can address these problems
Persuadee: ok .60 firm this time
Persuader: I am so glad you are willing to donate.
Persuader: Before you donate I just want u to think about how much money you spend on unnecessary items like eating out, snacks, going out.
Persuader: Money can be used in so many more meaningful ways..
Persuader: Dont you agree
Persuadee: Yes but that is a private issue between me and me, not you and me.
Persuader: Ok you are correct.
Persuader: I was meaning to offend you.
Persuader: I was speaking for all people including myself.

Persuader: IN 2018 alone 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in violence.
Persuader: Most of these children have grown up facing the threat of daily violence.
Persuader: YOu donation is going to help address these problems.
Persuadee: .60 still sounds good to me.
Persuadee: Lets leave it at that.

Persuadee: I would be interested in doing do, however I must tell you I am generally very skeptical about charity orginizations in general.
Persuadee: I know of many that I do not support due to the 6 figure salaries of the CEO.
Persuadee: And the fact that not much of the donation actually get to the ""cause"".
Persuader: I completely understand the skepticism due to a tenfold of shady organizations these days.

Persuader: Donate some money maybe?
Persuadee: 30 dollars a month can change a child's life

Persuadee: What a worthwhile cause!
Persuader: They also have a website  URL if you would like to look it up and make sure it's a legit organization

Persuader: That's true, not everyone has the means to give.

Persuadee: Ah, yes, the ""if everyone gave a dollar"" argument.
Persuadee: It is what gave birth to the whole crowdfunding platform.
Persuader: It's not an argument.
Persuader: It's a fact that small donations by large numbers of people can have an impact.
Persuader: The merit of the cause is an entirely different matter?
Persuadee: Indeed, but how do we know the donation aren't simply buying another yacht for an executive?
Persuader: A review of the tax exempt paperwork and financial statements, which are available for all tax exempt organizations, can help you weed out good from bad.
Persuader: Save The Children is transparent
Persuadee: Maybe, but financial statements are always ""summaries"" and not everyone is fluent in legalese
Persuader: I think you sell people short, especially since we are talking about numbers in a table.
Persuader: People can see where the numbers go.

Persuader: It probably adds up, assuming everyone pitches in a little.
Persuadee: Agreed, which is probably what they want.
Persuader: I'd assume so.
Persuader: I've done hits kind of like this, where the end goal seemed to be to gauge peoples charitable giving with their task payments.
Persuadee: oh yeah, absolutely!!
Persuader: I'm a sucker for helping people when I can.
Persuadee: At least you're doing some good, though.

Persuadee: I do not want to donate any of my reward for this hit.
Persuadee: I make donations to charity regularly but not from jobs that I do.
Persuader: Save the Children is a great international no-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuader: It has a very low overhead and almost all the money donated to it is directly used to help children.
Persuadee: I know that it is a good organization and I support them.
Persuadee: However I am not getting a reward from this hit.
Persuadee: I am spending my time completing it so I am being paid for a job.
Persuadee: I want the money to do with as I choose.
Persuader: Save the Children has helped build hundreds of schools in developing nations around the world.
Persuader: They've educated many children who have gone on to do important medical and other life saving jobs.
Persuadee: I still do not want to make a donation from this money.
Persuader: Another example is in Syria over 1,000 children have already been killed this year!
Persuader: Save the Children is helping to evacuate as many children as possible from that country.
Persuader: Don't you think every child deserves a long and happy life?
Persuadee: Yes I do think that they do.
Persuader: Don't you want to be part of the solution by giving as much money as possible to Save the Children so they can help as many children as possible?
Persuadee: I do not want to make a donation today.
Persuader: Think about how you were probably going to just waste the measly reward amount you were being offered for this HIT on junk food or coffee and think about what amazing things Save the Children would be able to do with that money.
Persuadee: I am not going to waste the reward.
Persuadee: I use it for things that my family needs.
Persuader: Think about how much more those poor kids in developing countries needs the money.
Persuader: Your family is rich enough to live in a first world country and have food on a daily basis.
Persuader: By not donating this tiny amount you're directly allowing children to sufer.
Persuadee: We work for everything that we have.
Persuadee: Nothing is just given to us soooo I am not going to give away something that I work for unless I want to do so.
Persuader: Of course you work for everything you own.
Persuader: By helping Save the Children you will directly be allowing a child to grow up and work for things him or herself rather than living in poverty and possibly not even making it out of childhood.
Persuadee: It still does not change the fact that I am not going to make a donation with this money.
Persuader: Save the Children will even let you know about the specific child that your money is helping.
Persuader: So you will really get to know that one child.
Persuader: It's not just some faceless organization with faceless non existant children.
Persuader: Everything is completly real and on the up and up.
Persuadee: I understand this and have supported Unbound a similar charity for years.
Persuadee: Since I already donate to a charity like this I am not making a donation.
Persuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now?
Persuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

Persuader: In countries like Syria, 1000 children have been killed during the civil war.
Persuader: Isn't that insane?
Persuadee: That is terrible.
Persuadee: I wish this wasn't true.

Persuadee: Hi, it all depends on who you really are, if it's for a person very close to me if I'm willing
Persuader: It would go to supporting children in developing countries, especially in war zones.
Persuader: For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

Persuader: Do you have children yourself?
Persuader: Does this cause have a very personal meaning to you?
Persuadee: If I have two very beautiful children that are my life, maybe that's why I'm very attentive to things like this of this magnitude
Persuader: What would you say to someone who does not have children, if you were trying to get them to help the cause?
Persuadee: to think about all the needs that a child in need at this moment is helping, and to think that this may be their child
Persuader: Children really are the future and if humans have any hope of surviving in the long run, we need to raise our children to see the good in this world and help others

Persuadee: are you involved with charity
Persuader: Yes!
Persuader: I really prefer local charities but some nationwide and international ones are very dear to my heart.
Persuader: Whenever we have the opportunity to donate from our task rewards I always try to give a little bit.

Persuadee: i am also a follower of Unicef, are you familiar
Persuader: Yes, I've heard of Unicef.

Persuader: The ratings are from different companies such as Better Business Bureau and American Institute of Philanthropy.

Persuader: Wow that would be cool What are your other favorite charities?
Persuadee: I think Red Cross does a broad array of services
Persuader: Yes they do I like St Judes Childrens Hospital also
Persuadee: I think charities that provide for a broad array of services are more ideal than focused because they target many people
Persuader: That's a good outlook.
Persuader: I think its good there are some speciality ones out there also though.
Persuadee: I agree.
Persuadee: I dont think there is any shortage of people who need help.
Persuadee: I like to be able to help as many as possible
Persuader: I guess having had children the St Judes hospital makes you think what if and what would i do
Persuadee: Your perspective is helpful.
Persuadee: This reminds me of Ronald McDonald as well
Persuader: Yes the way they work together is great.
Persuader: The parents never have to pay anything or worry about anything but their child.
Persuadee: I had heard about the McDonald's charity and see the change box, but I did not know much about it until a customer told me his son used their services when i was getting food once
Persuader: I know Shriners has helped a couple people I know when they were children they each had a club foot and poor parents and shriners did all the surgery for free

Persuader: I just found out that this charity is actually still on the ground in Texas helping kids that were devastated by hurricane Harvey.
Persuader: I think that is pretty cool, don't you?
Persuadee: that's very cool!
Persuader: Yeah, I think so!
Persuader: They are also active right now helping parents out with hurricane Lane.
Persuader: which I thought was pretty eye-opening.
Persuader: The more I read about them, the more I am thinking that they are a very worthy charity organization.
Persuader: It looks like they do fantastic work right here at home as well as globally.
Persuadee: That's pretty awesome.
Persuadee: I think everyone kind of forgot that those affected still need help
Persuader: Yeah.
Persuader: You know once the news media goes away I think people have a tendency to forget about how severe the impact was, but it took years and years after Katrina, remember that.
Persuader: Kind of sad how bad it got down there, but also amazing how everyone came together to help out.
Persuadee: Exactly.
Persuadee: I agree.
Persuadee: if there isn't coverage then people tend put it out of their minds.
Persuadee: but this group sounds great!
Persuadee: Glad they are helping out
Persuader: Absolutely, and actually you have an opportunity to donate some of your HIT to this charity to help these kids out, and you can donate any amount  up to the total amount of your HIT to help these kids out, interested?
Persuadee: I am thinking about it.
Persuadee: I dont see why I wouldn't
Persuader: I dont see why I wouldn't
Persuader: I think it would be really touching if you did and a great little one of those 'be kind to others' moments kinda like sneaking a quarter into someones parking meter just because, and every cent goes to those kids.
Persuadee: Oh for sure.
Persuadee: Is there like, an average donation or something?
Persuader: However much you want to donate up to the .30 but of course the more you give, the better off the kids will be and the better off these entire families will be. Imagine how much can be raised if everyone donated a single HIT to these kids.
Persuadee: Oh i see.
Persuadee: That makes sense.
Persuader: Awesome!
Persuader: I am so excited that you agree!
Persuadee: I will give .20

Persuader: Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.
Persuader: I have problems too.
Persuader: But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.

Persuadee: I have 10 cents I can give.

Persuader: yes it is and if you just donated a portion of what you make from this task it would be a big help
Persuadee: Well, I already donae to other charities so I'm not sure.
Persuader: I see children everyday even in my community who do not have enough to eat and they are not able to afford to go to the doctor.
Persuader: The only meal they get are the free meals from school.

Persuadee: Ok, I will do 5 cents of my task money.
Persuader: thank you so much for this.

Persuadee: ohh how much donation would yoy expect?
Persuader: Your donation can be from $0 to all of the payment for this task.
Persuader: But before you decide hastily, I would like to remind you that Save the Children is one of the only charities doing what it does.
Persuader: There are children out there now without access to housing, clean water, education, and many other things we often take for granted.
Persuader: So please, consider thoughtfully whether you would be willing to make a sacrifice for the children of the world.
Persuadee: how do i trust the organiation?
Persuader: Save the Children is a world-renowned NGO with a trusted history and background.
Persuader: You can read about their successes on their website:   URL
Persuader: Also, they have been given high ratings from different charity watchodgs.
Persuadee: okay i will check it.. by the way how much did you donate?
Persuader: I donated $2, which is the maximum payment.
Persuader: I understand that everyone cannot commit to making a serious donation, but when we think about children suffering, we have a moral imperative to act in their defense.
Persuadee: okay i will donate $1
Persuader: If it's not too much to ask, I would like you to consider donating perhaps more.
Persuader: After all, there are children in Syria now growing up facing threats of violence everyday.
Persuader: Surely an additional dollar, which we might spend on a cup of coffee or a bag of chips, could more greatly aid them then us.
Persuadee: no i am okay with this amount
Persuader: OK, I will not force you to make a decision you don't want to.
Persuader: I will just ask you to consider how you would feel if your child was danger like many children are.
Persuadee: actually i am not donating like this.. if i would like to donate money i will give food and clothes to the kids directly
Persuader: While that is possible in a local community, it fails to take into account the suffering of kids in developing countries around the world, a specialty of Save the Children.
Persuader: Save the Children maximizes the efficiency of donations so that every dollar makes a difference.
Persuader: Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?
Persuadee: yes i am very much sure.
Persuadee: as of now i am donating $1
Persuader: Well, we at Save the Children would like to thank you for your donation and let you know that thanks to donors like you, children around the world are thankful

Persuadee: Does this charity help children in the United States, or do they deal mostly with children in African nations?
Persuader: It is a global charity.
Persuader: They help out children in the US and around the world.
Persuader: You should check out their website:  URL s/what-we-do/us-programs
Persuadee: I will copy and save the website address.
Persuadee: What do volunteers do for this charity?
Persuadee: I ask that because volunteering would be easier for me than sending money.

Persuader: They're a great charity I support.
Persuader: I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.
Persuadee: Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.
Persuadee: I do the same for World Vision.
Persuadee: I sponsor 3 children.
Persuader: That's amazing.
Persuader: When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.
Persuader: We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.
Persuader: So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.
Persuader: I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.
Persuadee: I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.
Persuadee: Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.
Persuadee: How long have you been donating?
Persuader: For years.
Persuader: I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.
Persuader: Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.
Persuader: You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.
Persuader: Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.
Persuader: I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.
Persuadee: That is good.
Persuadee: I've heard good things about Save the Children.
Persuadee: I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.
Persuadee: I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.
Persuadee: I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.
Persuader: Absolutely.
Persuader: We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.
Persuader: You know what, you've encouraged me.
Persuader: I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.
Persuader: You want to join me?
Persuader: It won't be much but every penny counts.
Persuader: We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.
Persuadee: Sure.
Persuadee: I would love to help.
Persuadee: I would love to make a donation today.
Persuader: That's amazing.
Persuader: Should we give our whole 30 cents?
Persuader: It's not like either of us can do much with that either.
Persuadee: Probably more.
Persuadee: Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?
Persuader: I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.
Persuader: Hassle free.
Persuadee: Ok, sounds good.
Persuadee: I'll donate the whole amount.
Persuader: I'm so glad I got partnered with you.
Persuader: With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.
Persuadee: Great.
Persuadee: I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.
Persuadee: Thanks for sharing.
Persuader: Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.
Persuader: So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.
Persuader: I'm going to blog about you later today.
Persuader: It will encourage our friends.
Persuadee: Very good.
Persuadee: I glad we can help.

Persuader: Save the Children helps provide essential basic needs providing for their health, safety, and education internationally.
Persuadee: Have you gone to a charity rating site to check on it?
Persuadee: I have not.
Persuadee: I want to be assured that overhead costs are minimized.
Persuader: As of Feb 2018 they were rated 97% transparant and an 88% total rating.
Persuader: They save children from horrible fates like starvation.
Persuader: Something simple and easy to fix.
Persuader: No child should ever lose their life for lack of food.
Persuadee: I'd prefer a secure food donation that directly transports to the areas the children live in instead of handing over to government officials.
Persuadee: I feel that using money to but food directly in their cities is best.
Persuader: Save the Children donations go straight to the needy.
Persuader: There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.
Persuader: For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence
Persuadee: I am willing to agree to 5 percent of my income for 6 months about 800 dollars.

Persuadee: That's awful.
Persuadee: I live in the US and wish we were doing more as a country to help these kids.
Persuadee: But private donations certainly help.
Persuader: You should consider that link, explore it, and make a small donation.
Persuader: Small donations will indeed help a lot of children and their families.
Persuadee: I'll certainly review it.
Persuadee: Usually I donate more to charities in my community, but international donations are important too.
Persuader: Yes, they all are.
Persuader: All of the children must be taken care of.
Persuader: I can tell you that your donation right now will make a tangible impact for the world
Persuadee: Have you donated to this organization?
Persuadee: I have a small budget but know any amount matters.
Persuader: Well it's cool that you are using mTurk.

Persuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now?
Persuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.
Persuader: You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.

Persuader: The Requester DAVIS will handle it all, very convenient.

Persuader: Since I can tell you really care, let's wrap up with you agreeing to donate your full amount, and then we can both move on to our next task.

Persuader: Excellent.
Persuader: Enjoy your day....let's go make some serious cash today!
Persuader: Rock on!
Persuadee: Hang on though.
Persuadee: We haven't each done ten responses per the instructions.

Persuadee: They definitely do.
Persuadee: Do you participate in any local children's charities?
Persuader: I volunteer at a local food bank.
Persuader: Many of the families that come to us have young children.
Persuader: Actions as well as donations help keep the Charity afloat and able to help children around the world
Persuadee: Right.
Persuadee: I used to tutor kids in my spare time in college.
Persuadee: I also tutored kids at a battered woman's shelter.
Persuadee: I have a bunch of baby clothes inwant to donate as well.
Persuadee: Helping children abroad is on my bucket list.
Persuader: Bucket lists are all well and good but sometimes we help out now.
Persuader: For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuadee: I saw a disheartening bstory on the news about some children that were injured due to that very violence.
Persuadee: What do you think is the best solution or way to help for the average person like you or Me to render aid?
Persuader: Save the Children works with government around the world to keep children from harm and abuse from crises situations by providing safe spaces for children to play, socialize, learn, and express themselves as they rebuild their lives.
Persuader: Child Friendly Spaces also serve as a protective mechanism from abuse and psychosocial distress helping children both during and following crises.
Persuadee: So you think monetary donations are the best course of action?
Persuadee: When iIsaid helping children around the world was on my bucket list (and iIshould not have ised that term, nor did I mean it lightly, I meant physically donating time and skills.
Persuader: Volunteering and helping others with your time and effort is great, but in the meantime how can you help?
Persuader: Donations let you help until you have the time and focus to knock those activities off your list.
Persuadee: St Jude's is another great organisation.
Persuader: Well you can donate now to Save the Children.
Persuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.
Persuader: You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.
Persuadee: I'm aware of how to donate and how easy it is.
Persuadee: You seem partial to save the children.
Persuadee: Do you have any personal connection with that charity?
Persuader: I have worked with some charities in the past, Our Daily Bread for one, and I like the fact that Save the Children's focus is solely on the welfare of children.
Persuader: They are a particularly vulnerable group and I find it reassuring that nearly 90% of every dollar you give goes straight to their mission ??Â¸??Â¸ helping children grow up healthy, learning and safe.
Persuader: This percentage is adjusted each year end ??Â¸??Â¸ as of 2017, it is 86%.
Persuader: The rest they for running their programs and raising funds to help more children.
Persuadee: I used to manage a store and we often picked childrens charities to give to.
Persuadee: It always bothered me when folks would say '' need y'all to donate to me' and then decline to donate.
Persuadee: I think people fail to realize that without healthy, cared for, nurtured children, our future as a humanity becomes jeapodized.
Persuader: Would you help out in this small way?
Persuader: Your donation would be helping children really even a little bit helps so much.

Persuadee: Hello!
Persuader: I am supposed to ask you if you care about people being killed in Syria and things like that, I don't want to cause you any emotional discomfort by talking about suffering people.
Persuader: Is that okay?
Persuader: To talk about suffering people and children for a minute?
Persuadee: I will have no discomfort discussing suffering people.
Persuader: I think the refugee crisis is crazy, I am not sure what I would do if I was raising my kids in Syria.
Persuader: If anyone could have fun in those spots it's kids though.
Persuadee: I feel really torn about the crisis.
Persuadee: I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.
Persuadee: At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.
Persuader: I actually didn't think of it like that.
Persuader: I am a parent too, it feels so foreign what they are going through.
Persuader: This whole chat thing is supposed to get me to get you to donate to Save the Children, but now I think they got me to do it instead!
Persuader: I don't know if that's really okay to do though.
Persuadee: I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked.
Persuadee: I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call ""stupid"".
Persuadee: I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.
Persuadee: Sorry Im getting off topic.
Persuader: No, that's relevant.
Persuader: Really relevant.
Persuader: It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.
Persuader: I usually donate in hopes I can at least feel like I did my part.
Persuader: If I donated and some corrupt person took it, that's the worst karma and even worst scandal imaginable.
Persuader: The people who donate and people who are worrying about that are the same people.
Persuader: You're not a horrible person it sounds like, just worried if what you do even matters.
Persuadee: With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.
Persuadee: My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.
Persuadee: SHe picked out a child with the same birth month as one of her kids.
Persuadee: I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!
Persuader: I feel like you are smart enough and definitely moral enough to be the boss.
Persuader: I hope you have success  in your field.
Persuader: I don't have that great of a job or boss but I'd still  I would like to match a donation with you if you're willing to try help kids with me.
Persuader: I am parent and I feel like I need extra help sometimes too , but knowing that I could REALLY help them makes feel like a better parent.
Persuadee: I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.
Persuadee: They are the weak ones in my eyes.
Persuader: I don't want you to donate any more than you want, so if you want to donate how much do you to do?
Persuader: I think any amount you give (especially more) will definitely help and I want you to know that it would be deducted from you task payment.
Persuader: Whatever you choose to do or the amount you want to give, I feel like you've changed my mind about charity, not the other way around, so I want to thank you for that.
Persuadee: I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.
Persuadee: I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think.
Persuader: If you're doing this task then you might be able to afford it, but if you can I'd probably say you should really donate it all just this one time.
Persuader: So whatever you donate I can donate as well, and can actually help each other donate to the kids.
Persuader: You want to match all our payment to Save the Children?
Persuader: Would that be okay?
Persuader: Or should we lock in your half payment?
Persuadee: I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.
Persuadee: I would lock into half.
Persuader: Sure let's do it.
Persuader: I might donate a little more I don't know how to do that but, I think they deserve it, I'm convince by talking to you that people regardless of how they feel about refugees that they can still care about kids.
Persuadee: I agree if we don't take care of the kids we risk losing a whole generation of people!
Persuader: Oh, I didn't think of it like that either.
Persuader: I always picture like you said about your boss, one kid.
Persuader: But you're right it's a whole generation, that's A LOT of people.

Persuader: Today, for instance, is our End of Summer Carnival for the kids.
Persuader: Its one of our largest fundraisers of the year.
Persuadee: Wow, that sounds really fun.
Persuadee: Time and money donations are really two important aspects for charities.

Persuader: Given your love for children and your work, would you be willing to donate a small amount to Save the Children?
Persuadee: yes I would be honored to.
Persuadee: Since I am a nursing student and paying for tuition out of pocket, my donation amount may not be too great but I would like to donate something.
Persuadee: So I like to donate $5 to the cause

Persuader: Have you seen the kids in Syria?
Persuadee: I have seen some of the images and video of the civil war there.
Persuader: Those kids are growing up in tents and being bombed every day.
Persuadee: True -- but how much money is currently being provided by US and NATO to help?
Persuader: They have provided the tents.
Persuader: Still it isn't enough.
Persuader: The kids there are struggling.
Persuadee: I have to question that they have provided only tents.
Persuadee: Many countries have absorbed many refugees and I am fairly certain that way more aid than tents has been provided.
Persuader: True, but there - the kids are lucky to get a meal a day.
Persuader: Save the children helps with that.
Persuadee: It may -- but at this point I really still have no idea what Save the Children is and I would want to research it anyway before I would agree to give money to it.
Persuader: I think thats a good idea.
Persuadee: Additionally, I am just very skeptical of any organization that asks for money.

Persuadee: Yes, I feel like if anything could use more funding, it should be children who need extra assistance.
Persuader: Would you be willing to make a pledge to donate at least 100 every month?
Persuadee: Hm, it depends on my schedule to be honest because I still have to pay rent and I don't have set hours but I'd be willing to give around $100 if I have solid hours every month.
Persuader: It good to stand by your word and giving to the children.
Persuader: And I thank you

Persuadee: I like the sound of that.
Persuadee: Does it work by sponsoring a specific child who you get to know or does everything run through the organization?
Persuader: he money goes to the charity as a whole not to a particular kid, so when you donate you know you helping more than one child.

Persuader: things must be always clear to the public eyes .
Persuadee: True, especially if you take part in donating.

Persuader: I believe they've been around for almost 100 years, so hopefully they have a pretty effecient organization.

Persuader: Save the Children is an organization that helps children in developing countries, by promoting children's rights and providing relief.
Persuader: I think they help pay for their education and other necessities.

Persuader: I feel the same.
Persuader: It makes me so sad to know that some children are having a hard time even finding clean water to drink.

Persuadee: I can not imagine food or clothing being a luxury.

Persuadee: I'd rather give to Ronald McDonalds especially since I know people who have personally benefited.

Persuadee: I've heard a little bit about it but don't know too much.
Persuader: From what I've read, it's a nonprofit that helps children in difficult situations around the world.
Persuader: I was reading about their aid work in Syria and how they've helped young girls in developing countries receive schooling.
Persuadee: Oh wow!
Persuadee: That's incredible.
Persuadee: I wasn't aware that they did all of that.
Persuader: This morning, I was also reading about an ebola outbreak in the Congo (I think).
Persuader: I imagine they'll help there if they aren't stretched too thin.
Persuadee: So save the children is a worldwide organization it sounds like!
Persuader: It is!
Persuader: Do you ever donate to organizations like this?
Persuader: My brother, sister, and I replaced birthday gifts with charity donations a few years ago.
Persuader: It saved on clutter and felt great to give to charities.
Persuadee: I've given to a few charities before, but never this one.
Persuadee: I'm always so skeptical of charities to be honest.
Persuader: Same here.
Persuader: I remember reading about some questionable charities following hurricanes in Haiti and Puerto Rico.
Persuader: It's a bummer when that money gets siphoned off.

Persuadee: I think money that goes to kids is a super important cause.

Persuader: I agree!
Persuader: I think that the internet helps, too.

Persuader: Donations make a huge difference in the lives of these kids.
Persuader: Your help will give them access to food, healthcare, education, and safety, among other things.
Persuadee: Yes, I agree.
Persuadee: Helping children and pets is one of the donations I enjoy making and helping at the same time.
Persuader: Do you have an amount in mind that you'd like to donate?
Persuadee: I was thinking to donate around 10 cents for save the children.
Persuadee: I hope that is adequate and helps them for food and shelter.
Persuader: Any amount we can collect for them is welcome.
Persuader: Would it convince you to donate more if I can assure you that the donation is absolutely secure and will be completely given to a trustworthy, verified fund within Save the Children?
Persuadee: ok how about 20 cents.
Persuadee: I do want to help in anyway that I can.
Persuader: Thank you so much.
Persuader: It's really appreciated.
Persuader: The amount of suffering that children around the world face is terrible.
Persuader: For example, in the first two months of 2018, a thousand children in Syria were injured in the violence there.
Persuader: Anything you can add to the donation will go directly to helping them.
Persuadee: yeah I heard a little bit about on how children are suffering.
Persuadee: I want to give a donation to help them.
Persuadee: I am glad I can help in anyway that I can.
Persuader: It will make a big difference to Save the Children.
Persuader: The organization has done wonders for kids, saving them from everything from violence to starvation.
Persuader: We as people have a moral responsibility to help them, and when we have extra, there's no better place to put it than in the hands of a trustworthy charity that will use it to save kids.
Persuadee: Yes, I believe it is good to be ethical.
Persuadee: And to help children and animals as much as we can.
Persuadee: Most of all save the children is a trustworthy organization which I trust to put my donations in with.

Persuadee: Yes that is correct
Persuader: Is there anything you'd like to ask, or any way I can convince you to send a little more to Save the Children in the interests of the kids they work to help?
Persuadee: I feel that 20 cents is adequate for the donation.
Persuadee: I want to help in any way that I can.
Persuadee: Also I want to verify that this organization is most trusting.
Persuader: Alright, 20 cents out of the whole task payment amount.

Persuadee: I would certainly be willing to donate then
Persuader: How much are you willing to donate?
Persuadee: I would be willing to donate $200
Persuader: That is very generous.
Persuader: Would you be willing to donate a bit more.
Persuader: Say $500?
Persuader: From what I have learned, by donating $500, another organization will match the donation with a minimum $500 donation.
Persuadee: I would certainly increase my donation if it would be matched since the majority of it is going directly to the children
Persuader: That's wonderful!
Persuader: So I can count on you for the $500 donation?
Persuadee: Yes you can count on my donation

Persuadee: Thank you Glad I was able to help  this organization with my donation

Persuadee: I could certainly ask some of my coworkers and tell them about the match if they donate at least $500 and tell them what a worthy cause it is.
Persuader: Or how about an office pool to raise money?
Persuadee: We really dont have a big office so I dont think an office pool would get very much in donations
Persuader: Ok, that makes sense.
Persuader: Anything you could get in donations would certainly help.

Persuadee: Hello
Persuader: So it looks like you have the option to donate some of your earnings from this task to Save the Children.
Persuader: Have you heard of that charity before?
Persuadee: Know I have not.
Persuadee: Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: Please explain to me in detail
Persuader: It's an international organization that supports children in developing countries.
Persuader: It helps children get access to health, education, safety, etc.
Persuadee: Okay.
Persuadee: What is the organization called?
Persuader: It's called Save the Children.
Persuader: It's a rather large organization and well known, you can search for it outside this chat.
Persuader: It's not just a made up organization for the sake of the chat.
Persuader: Do you donate much to charity now?
Persuadee: O I have heard of Save the children.
Persuadee: I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity.
Persuadee: Currently I do not donate to charities.
Persuadee: I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget.
Persuadee: I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.
Persuader: I understand.
Persuader: I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend.
Persuader: I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday.
Persuader: However, donating to charity does help those even less fortunate than me, so I try to carve out some money here and there to help out.
Persuader: It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either.
Persuadee: I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today.
Persuadee: I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.
Persuader: I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding.
Persuader: If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation
Persuadee: Okay.
Persuadee: So if I decide to make a small donation, do I donate by using my mturk earnings?
Persuader: Yes, I believe so.
Persuader: Based on what I'm reading in the directions, you'd donate from the earnings you'd get from doing this task
Persuadee: Okay that is nice and simple.
Persuader: Absolutely!
Persuader: I agree.
Persuader: I really enjoy when things like this are easy to do.
Persuader: I don't know how much time we have left to chat, but it's been great to (electronically) meet you!
Persuadee: It has been great to electronically meet you too.
Persuadee: I am not sure how much time we have left and I don't know what to next ha ha.
Persuader: Oh wait, we need at least 10 minimum chat turns.
Persuader: So we'll need to chat a little bit more about donations; is there any particular issue going on with children in the world today that you've been following in the news or that you care more about?
Persuadee: So when it comes to issues, a specific issue that I really care about is the problem with the poverty issue in the United States.
Persuadee: To be specific I worry about the homeless rate with children.
Persuadee: For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you?
Persuader: I agree.
Persuader: I grew up in California, lived in Louisiana, and then moved to Massachusetts.
Persuader: There's different kinds of childhood poverty between those three states and I wish there was more I could do to help.
Persuader: If you're an adult and you're homeless it's a very different situation than being 6 years old and homeless.
Persuader: We talk a lot about children in other countries, but there's a lot of need for American children too.
Persuader: I'm hoping you'll keep half for you and your own child, and half for Save the Children too!
Persuadee: That is cool that you lived in three different states.
Persuadee: Before I lived in New Mexico I also lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota.
Persuadee: There is a poverty problem in all three states, but out of the three states that I lived,  New Mexico is definitley the top state for the poverty issue.
Persuadee: I completely agree with you.
Persuadee: I feel like our country does not focus enough on our issue with poverty.
Persuadee: Especially with children.
Persuadee: The issue with children poverty has to change.
Persuadee: I will take the option of donating into consideration.
Persuader: Absolutely!
Persuader: It was great meeting you, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your morning.
Persuadee: You as well. Thank you for the chat :)",Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,Emotional,Yes,Yes,Yes,Concrete,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No

Persuader: I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.

Persuadee: What's Save the Children all about?
Persuader: They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.
Persuader: They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate
Persuadee: Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?
Persuader: They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home

Persuader: That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.
Persuader: People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

Persuader: The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.

Persuadee: It's great to earn extra money here and there.
Persuadee: I'm glad you're enjoying it.
Persuader: Well thanks, Cassidy.
Persuader: It definitely seems like a fun way to make some extra money.
Persuader: I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.
Persuader: For example, I like to give a little money to charity each month.
Persuader: And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.
Persuader: How about you, Cassidy?
Persuader: Do you like giving to charities?
Persuadee: I do enjoy donating to charities.
Persuadee: I don't usually have a ton of extra money so it's not an every month kind of thing for me but I try to give at least once a year.
Persuadee: And when I can't give monetarily donate food, my time, and go to blood drives on my university

Persuader: Have you heard of Save the Children?
Persuadee: No, I haven't heard of Save the Children.
Persuadee: And its awesome that you help out those kids in need
Persuader: The thing is, Cassidy, is that I don't have any of my own right now, so it kind of fills a need, you know?
Persuader: I like Save the Children because they rank towards the top of reputable charities on the ranking sites.
Persuader: The other thing is that they allow for small donations which have a big impact in countries like Syria where the local currency has dropped so considerably.
Persuader: It's really really sad what's going on over there.
Persuader: Anyways, even 50 cents goes a long way you know?
Persuadee: Yeah, 50 cents isn't too bad.
Persuadee: Maybe I'll consider donating to them
Persuader: Well, personally, I've made about 8 dollars already here today, so I'm going to donate the 30 cents from this HIT to them.

Persuadee: But do you really trust the charities that you give to?
Persuadee: Do you know if they are actually using that money for the intended purpose?
Persuader: YEs I always look into the charities that i donate to.
Persuader: For instance I always donate to our local childrens hospital because my nephew was treat there when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Persuader: I saw how many sick little kids where there fight for their lives.
Persuader: So I also donate to the hospital and childrens cancer network because the money goes directly to research cancers that effect children.
Persuadee: I agree, the local charities are good.
Persuadee: I don't trust the bigger charities.
Persuadee: I think most of the money that is donated goes towards salaries, etc.
Persuader: Sadly that is true some times.
Persuader: How do you feel about donating to childrens charities?
Persuadee: I think it is better to help children yourself.
Persuadee: That way, you know what the money is being used for.
Persuadee: Also, when you do it yourself, it is a lot more rewarding.
Persuader: True, but there are so many innocent little children who don't have access to food or clean water, not to mention basic health needs.

Persuader: I try to donate at least 250 every year.

Persuadee: Do you have any kids?

Persuader: 1 has a lot of  health issues so childrens charities are always important to me.
Persuader: Do you have children?
Persuadee: I do not have any children yet.
Persuadee: do you think that having kids had a big effect on whether on not you are willing to donate to a children's charity?
Persuader: Yes, probably but my nephew got sick before I had kids and thats what made me realize that cancer or any illness can happen to anyone whether its your child or some one close to you.
Persuader: It is the scariest thing that can happen to anyone especially a child.
Persuader: Once I saw how many children were fighting cancer and other serious disease it woke me up to what is important in life and just because we are not going through it there are so many children suffering that the least I can do is donate.
Persuadee: That is a great way to think about it.
Persuadee: I'm sure that when I have kids, my thinking will change a lot as well.
Persuadee: So I think that we should donate .10 each to the children.

Persuader: Yes I am fine with that
Persuadee: It is a small amount, but I think that every penny can make a lot of difference.

Persuader: How are you tonight?
Persuadee: Hey, I am fine!!
Persuadee: How are you
Persuader: How are you
Persuader: I am good.
Persuader: Have you heard of Save the children?
Persuadee: It sounds familiar.
Persuadee: I think I have heard of it.
Persuader: I think I have heard of it.
Persuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: Yeah, I just looked it up.
Persuadee: :)  I like that it's non-governmental.
Persuader: Yes I love that too.
Persuader: It ensures childrens right to health, education and so on.
Persuader: Do you ever volunteer or make donations?
Persuadee: I'll be honest with you, I have made donations to children's charities in the past.
Persuadee: Like when I was in my twenties, but these days I have only made donations to animal rescue groups within the past two years.
Persuadee: It's a very long story that begins with me witnessing a severe animal abuse (cats) case in my town.
Persuader: You are an amazing person for caring for these  babies.
Persuader: Animals are like children.
Persuader: In the first 2 months of 2018 alone 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured.
Persuader: Save the Children is an amazing organization.
Persuadee: How were these children killed or injured -- because I know that many people (children too) are slaughtered on the highway in horrific road accidents.
Persuadee: If Save the Children helps those children who are orphaned or injured like this, then it is an amzing organization.Is that what this applies to?
Persuader: The children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuader: Syrian children have grown up facing daily threat of violence.
Persuadee: I watched a video on YouTube a couple of years ago.
Persuadee: It was Syrian children in a classroom, they were coloring pictures.
Persuadee: It completely broke my heart because of their precious sweet innocence and intelligence.
Persuadee: Their lives were in danger constantly from the threat of terrorism.
Persuader: It is so sad that children have to been in the middle of all the hate in the world today.
Persuader: It breaks my heart to see and hear of how bad children have to live and what they go thru each and every single day.
Persuadee: Me too.
Persuadee: I think about the little face I saw and since it was so long ago, I wonder if each and every one is okay -- still alive.
Persuader: Making a small donation today will indeed help children and their families in such sad situations.
Persuader: Would you be willing to donate from your task payment today?
Persuadee: Absolutely.
Persuadee: I hope everyone does.
Persuader: I most definitely agree.
Persuader: How much will you be donating today?
Persuadee: Whatever my task payment will be.
Persuadee: I have no money right now which is why I'm on Mturk tonight.
Persuadee: I live with my parents and I just bought a car last week which caused me an overdraft which I won't be caught up on until this coming Friday.
Persuader: I completely understand that.
Persuader: We are all trying to survive in life.
Persuader: Thank you so much for your contribution.
Persuader: Feel free to check out

Persuader: Oh no, you are awesome.
Persuader: No need to be sorry.

Persuader: It's non governmental and international.
Persuader: It helps children and their families here and in poor countries.
Persuader: Have you been to the site?
Persuadee: I have never been to the site.
Persuadee: Could you provide me with the link
Persuader: sure, it's  URL There you will see that for the price of a soda you can help a child in need.
Persuader: Would you like to donate?
Persuadee: Not today but I'll definitely save the website for the future.
Persuadee: What type of help do you provide to those poor families?
Persuader: They help children in war zones.
Persuader: Wouldn't you like to donate something today?

Persuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.
Persuader: You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment
Persuadee: I appreciate you informing about this but i'll be donsting at a later time
Persuader: maybe you will reconsider, acting today is the best way to directly help children and families in need.
Persuader: It won't hurt to donate $25 today, how bout it?
Persuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children for us.
Persuadee: Could you explain to me what the 25$ will go to exactly, is it for building houses, farms, shelters,...
Persuader: sure, you can sponsor a child, help with U.s. relief or health and education for a child in a developing country.

Persuader: I'm doing well, thank you!
Persuader: Have you ever heard of the charity Save the Children?
Persuadee: I have not.
Persuadee: What do they do?
Persuader: Save the Children is a great charity that provides education, healthcare, and advocacy to children in need in the U.S. and all over the world.
Persuader: Does this sound like a good charity to you?
Persuadee: It does.
Persuadee: Children are one of the worlds most important assets.
Persuader: I think so too!
Persuader: Do you believe that children in need deserve help from others?
Persuadee: Yes.
Persuadee: Children are more deserving in my opinion, because they are unable to care for themselves.
Persuadee: They have no choice but to rely on others.
Persuader: That's great that you care so much about children's needs!
Persuader: Save the Children is an exceptional charity in that over 86% of the donations go directly to children's programs all over the world.
Persuader: Have you donated to a charity before?
Persuadee: Yes, I usually donate to soldiers or veteran related charities such as Wounded Warrior Project.
Persuader: Those are great causes also.
Persuader: You mentioned earlier that you believe children to be one of the world's most important assets.
Persuader: Would you be willing to donate your earnings from this task to Save the Children?
Persuadee: I would if I had a specific break down or list of what programs the donations support.
Persuader: Save the Children make the programs they support and the percentage of funding for each one available on their website.
Persuader: They are very transparent!
Persuader: Some of the causes they support include Emergencies (38%), Health and Nutrition (36%), and Education to more than 136 thousand children all over the world.
Persuader: The researchers curating this task collect the earnings from those who donate and send them directly to Save the Children.
Persuader: How much of your earnings would you be willing to donate?
Persuadee: I don't make a lot.
Persuadee: I would have donate a smaller amount.
Persuadee: Like a one time donation of 100$ or so.
Persuader: That's great!
Persuader: And any amount will go directly to benefiting children.
Persuader: However in this case I'm only asking about your earnings from this particular task :) .
Persuader: The full amount would be 30 cents.
Persuadee: I guess so
Persuader: Great!
Persuader: Thank you for your donation and for supporting children in need.

20180826-210609_644_live,"Persuader: Hello!
Persuadee: Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?
Persuader: Yes, I absolutely have.
Persuader: Save the Children is a great organization.
Persuader: They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.
Persuadee: I have not heard of Save the Children before.
Persuadee: Sounds like they really help education wise.
Persuader: They do.
Persuader: But they also assist in other ways.
Persuader: I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.
Persuadee: Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.
Persuadee: Oh so they do more than just help with education.
Persuadee: Thats awesome!
Persuader: Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.
Persuader: I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.
Persuadee: I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.
Persuadee: WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.
Persuader: I couldn't agree more.
Persuader: For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.
Persuadee: It sure does.
Persuadee: ANything else I should know about this charity?
Persuader: It is a huge movement.
Persuader: They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.
Persuadee: WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.
Persuadee: SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?
Persuader: Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!
Persuader: These kids really deserve it :)
Persuadee: I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.
Persuader: You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.
Persuader: Literally every penny helps these children.
Persuader: I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.
Persuader: Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.
Persuadee: Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.
Persuadee: So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?
Persuadee: Do i pay online or how do I go about it?
Persuader: Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.
Persuader: In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.
Persuader: The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.
Persuader: There's no paying online or entering payment info.
Persuader: It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)
Persuadee: Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.
Persuadee: YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.
Persuader: You are AWESOME!
Persuader: How much of your payment would you like to donate today?
Persuader: As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)
Persuadee: I will donate 0.05 cents today.

20180826-220528_999_live,"Persuader: How do you feel about childrens charities?
Persuader: Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?
Persuadee: I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society.
Persuadee: We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening.
Persuadee: I do have a soft spot for children.
Persuadee: As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through.
Persuadee: I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need.
Persuadee: Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.
Persuader: I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can.
Persuader: I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses.
Persuader: I think the work that charities can do is so important.
Persuader: Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better.
Persuader: Have you heard about the charity Save the children?
Persuadee: yes I have.
Persuadee: In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general.
Persuadee: Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children.
Persuadee: One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition.
Persuadee: Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.
Persuader: It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children.
Persuader: You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does.
Persuader: I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?
Persuadee: I believe it could be true.
Persuadee: However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate.
Persuadee: One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy.
Persuadee: If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.
Persuader: I agree.
Persuader: It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity.
Persuader: It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact.
Persuader: Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?
Persuadee: Personally, transparency is especially vital.
Persuadee: When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours.
Persuadee: In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general.
Persuadee: If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem.
Persuader: I agree.
Persuader: I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund.
Persuader: Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so?
Persuadee: Honestly, it should be a choice.
Persuadee: I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily.
Persuadee: However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.
Persuader: I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it.
Persuader: I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation.
Persuader: I think most people would help just to help.
Persuader: Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?
Persuadee: I think so.
Persuadee: Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so.
Persuadee: If they don't, it's completely understandable.
Persuadee: In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to.
Persuadee: However, every cent counts.
Persuadee: It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is.
Persuadee: It's all about giving.
Persuader: I think that would be a more effective message sometimes.
Persuader: Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help.
Persuader: Do you think people would be more likely to donate if they say the impact very small donations could have?
Persuader: Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what?
Persuadee: Those are very good questions.
Persuadee: It depends on the way they see it.
Persuadee: Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could.
Persuadee: Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything.
Persuadee: Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child.
Persuader: I think a lot of people who do not have an extra $100 would still be willing to donate a small amount to a charity like save the children, if they had an easy way to do it.
Persuader: At the grocery store sometimes they will ask if I want to round up to the nearest dollar amount and donate that increase in change to charity.
Persuader: Do you think most people say yes to this?
Persuader: Or they would usually say maybe next time
Persuadee: Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to.
Persuadee: I have seen a lot of people do the same.
Persuadee: I think some people will say ""maybe next time"" if they aren\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\'t have the funds to do so.
Persuadee: When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy.
Persuader: This chat allows you to donate some of your task payment to Save the children.
Persuader: The research team collects all the donations people elect to give and send them to save the children to help support the work that they do globally.
Persuader: Do you think that you would elect to give some of your task payment?
Persuadee: Yes I would.
Persuadee: I'm in the process of racking up as much money as I can and donating part of that to Save the children.
Persuader: That is amazing.
Persuader: To be honest, I have really enjoyed your opinions on charitable giving like this. How much of your task payment do you want to donate now?
Persuader: You can choose any amount from $0 to all

Persuader: They are a very reputable international non-governmental organization dedicated to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.
Persuadee: cool, so what can i do
Persuader: The easiest way you can become involved with the organization initially is with monetary support.
Persuadee: ok so wht do you suggest?
Persuader: The easiest would be is to donated some or all of your incoming payment from this task today.
Persuadee: not so fast what does the money go to
Persuader: As I mentioned previously, for ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.

Persuadee: oh wow ok how much do you suggest?
Persuader: You can choose any amount from a few cents up to the full amount you'd get for the task today.

Persuader: how much are you willing to donate?
Persuadee: Well, I don't have much money right now.
Persuadee: All I can afford is $5.00.
Persuader: I think that is an excellent amount and would benefit Save the Children.
Persuader: For example,millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

Persuader: It is very thoughtful to donate to causes that benefit disadvantaged children.
Persuader: Your donation means a lot to that child in India
Persuadee: It is the least I can do for him.
Persuadee: Most people take for granted what they have in their lives, while there are so many thousands who do not even have the basic necessities.
Persuadee: Imagine not have clean water to drink.
Persuader: I cannot even begin to imagine that and clean water should be a basic right to every child on this planet.
Persuadee: I agree.

Persuadee: If only the governments and politicians of the world would stop fighting and actually work toward that goal.
Persuader: Yes I agree.
Persuader: That is why I donate what I can to organizations like Save the Children.
Persuader: As you may know, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuader: Are there any organizations that you can reccomend?
Persuadee: I sponsor through World Vision.
Persuadee: I like them because they are very transparent about where the money is going.
Persuadee: You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community.
Persuadee: And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general.
Persuadee: It is so satisfying to know you are making a real difference in someone's life, and maybe in many lives.
Persuader: I cannot thank you enough for that.
Persuader: How much do you donate on average annually?
Persuadee: Well it's $39 a month, so $468 annually.
Persuadee: I also send him little care packages every so often.
Persuadee: At Christmas I plan to send either $100 or $200 as a special gift to his family, which will enable them to buy a goat, some chickens, etc.
Persuadee: That will have such a big impact on their lives.

Persuadee: I think I'm okay.
Persuadee: No need to share more information
Persuader: I understand and I do not want to take up too much of your time.
Persuader: But please know that this organization ehlps children on every continent but Antartica.
Persuadee: Why not Antartica?
Persuader: There just isn't the population to warrant it.
Persuader: The climate is not sustainable for human life and children do not reside there.
Persuader: But in the other countries they provide emergency response, global advocacy,  literacy, and health education.
Persuadee: Well that's disappointing.
Persuadee: What country receives the most aid?
Persuader: It is spread out by need but rest assured that their charity ranges from Kentucky all the way to Kenya.
Persuader: Also, 86% of all expenditures go to program services so everyone that donates knows that their money is being used for a good cause rather than misappropriated.
Persuadee: Okay sounds interesting.
Persuadee: How do people donate to the charity?
Persuader: You can visit their website or I can assist you with donating today.

Persuader: Well, STC has already pledged to help the kids in Hawaii.

Persuader: Do you donate at all?
Persuadee: I'm pretty poor.
Persuadee: If I have money I try to donate to charities that I like.
Persuader: I am in the same boat.
Persuader: Have you heard of Save the Children?
Persuadee: No.
Persuadee: I don't believe I have.
Persuader: It's an organization that raises money for children all over the world in need, such as children from war torn countries like syria
Persuadee: I would not be interested in a charity that only targets children.
Persuader: See, I believe that the children are our future.
Persuader: If we don't help them now, they won't have the life they deserve.
Persuader: One could be the next president or something!
Persuadee: I've lived for 76 years and have only experienced two reasonably good presidents.
Persuadee: The way things are going I don't expect to experience any thing close to that again.
Persuader: Ha, well maybe not the best example currently...
Persuader: but a few cents can go a long way
Persuadee: My few cents would never go toward a children's charity.
Persuadee: If I have anything it will go to homeless shelters, food pantries and environmental causes.
Persuader: I do agree the money should go more towrads the whole family, but some children have lost their families, and have been left with nothing.
Persuader: They may end up being homeless and going to food pantries.
Persuader: Maybe we could prevent that from happening
Persuadee: That would be real low on my list of priorities.
Persuadee: People that demand perfect victims can donate to children's charities; I don't do that.
Persuader: Well i hear you.
Persuader: I think that any donation to anyone is helpful in this world.
Persuader: It should be specialized
Persuadee: I prefer to prioritize charities where lots of people don't like the victims.
Persuadee: Most people (unlike me) seem to like children so those charities don't have any trouble.
Persuader: You make a very good point, sir, but what if everyone felt that way!
Persuader: then the children would get nothing!
Persuadee: That really wouldn't bother me at all.
Persuader: well like I said, any donation is a good donation.

Persuader: Your donation will make a tangible impact for the world.

Persuader: It is the right thing to do.
Persuader: That helps people directly in your community.
Persuader: A lot of these children don't have people like you in their community.
Persuader: There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.
Persuader: For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

Persuadee: Im very good how are you doing today?
Persuader: I'm good thank you!
Persuader: So according to this I'm supposed to tell you a bit about the Save the Children organization.
Persuader: Have you heard of it before?
Persuadee: No i would be interested in learning
Persuader: So I just looked it up and they do a lot of work for children around the world.
Persuader: They do some work in and out of USA to give kids access to health care, education, and shelter.
Persuadee: Thats very beneficial.
Persuadee: Especially for third world country that have limited resources
Persuader: Definitely!
Persuader: They do a lot of work with emergency response stuff too which is pretty cool.
Persuadee: If we can donate alot to these organizations alot can be accomplished in the world.
Persuader: Yes definitely.
Persuader: It doesn't even take much.
Persuader: A couple cents could really help these kids!
Persuadee: definitely.
Persuadee: The more the merrier however anything as little as 10 cents can make a huge impact
Persuader: Oh yeah.
Persuader: That and they're pretty transparent which is good.
Persuader: It's not all given to the filthy rich CEO.
Persuadee: If we can get a group of Investors this organization can reach a larger spectrum
Persuader: I've never even heard of it before today which is pretty sad.
Persuadee: Yeah that means they need to develop a good marketing strategy to attract more attention
Persuader: Hmmm, I wonder if this is what that is?
Persuadee: Yea they should hire a specialist that can go into social media like Facebook, Instagram, and other sites to build a presence
Persuader: That's so true!
Persuader: So I guess now is the part where I ask if you'd like to donate any of your compensation to them?
Persuadee: Sure I like their mission and believe it can help a long way to help others
Persuader: Yay! How much would you like to donate?
Persuadee: I would love to donate $.50 cents

Persuadee: Hello.
Persuadee: How you doin
Persuader: pretty good.
Persuader: It looks like this chat is supposed to be to learn more about ""Save the Children"".
Persuader: Have you ever heard of it?
Persuadee: Yes I am aware of that charity
Persuader: It seems vaguely familiar but I never paid attention specifically.
Persuader: Have you ever donated to them?
Persuadee: I have not but I have to some others recently
Persuader: Do you feel that Save the Children is a good charity to give to?
Persuader: From what I'm reading, it sounds like a great cause
Persuadee: I know a little can you maybe provide some info for me?
Persuader: It seems to be international, and supports children in developing countries.
Persuader: It's apparently very influential in war zones like Syria
Persuadee: Oh wow that is good to know.
Persuadee: I know Syria is a mess recently
Persuader: Absolutely.
Persuader: It says on their site that in the first two months of this year alone, 1000 children were killed or injured there
Persuadee: Ugh that is rough..  Nobody deserves that in this world
Persuader: I can't imagine what that's like for the parents.
Persuader: As a mom myself, I'm thinking about donating my earnings from this task to them
Persuadee: That sounds like a good idea so what amount is the max i can donate?
Persuader: From what I can tell, we can donate anywhere from 0 to $2 (the full payment).
Persuader: Then through the official Save the Children website, I'm sure there's no max (and there'd be a tax deduction)
Persuadee: Ok good to know.
Persuadee: Thank you very much forthat info you have been very helpful!
Persuadee: I will donate all of $2 then :)
Persuader: How often do you donate to things like this?
Persuadee: There are always things in my community that I attend and donate as much as I can and donate my time as well at the local Salvation Army.
Persuader: I usually give to animal charities like the local no-kill shelter, but it's always interesting to learn about new places to make an impact.
Persuader: Do you feel that you donate more in terms of money, or in terms of volunteering your time?
Persuadee: More money but I enjoy giving the time
Persuader: I'm usually pretty busy so try to donate a little here and there.
Persuader: Anyway, glad to meet you!

Persuadee: I'm good.
Persuadee: How are you?
Persuader: I am doing great!
Persuader: I am here to let you know about this amazing international foundation called Save the Children that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support them in developing countries.
Persuadee: Please tell me more.
Persuader: These children are being used in horrific ways, the food and supplies that are supposed to be going to them are being stolen and we are trying to gather money to ensure the supplies get to these children who really need these supplies and help. With a donation today, not only will we be able to ensure the supply lines safely reach villages, but doctors will also go and help the children with medical care they desperately need.
Persuader: All I ask is that you donate a portion of your task payment to this charity to help the children.
Persuadee: How do I know this charity is legit?
Persuader: You are free to look up any information you like at  URL
Persuadee: How much of the donations goto the children and the effort?
Persuader: 100% of your donation will go directly to Save the Children.
Persuader: Just think of it this way, instead of getting your morning coffee, or that bag of chips at lunch, you could donate $2 today and help ensure that 3 children get the care they need and food in their stomachs.
Persuadee: Does 100% go to the effort directly or does any of the monies go to employees like the director of the charity ect?
Persuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it all directly to Save the children.
Persuader: So it will go to pay for the flights to get the team over there, medicine, food, everything needed to help these children
Persuadee: What roughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?
Persuader: Like I said earlier, 100% of your donation goes directly to helping these children.
Persuader: Look, already in 2018 alone, 1,000 children have been reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuader: They need your help.
Persuader: They need your donation more than you do honestly.
Persuader: What is $2 to you when that money can literally save lives over there?
Persuadee: There are many scams out there that take more to profit then to actually help the kids.
Persuadee: I need to know these things before I donate even if it is as little as $2.
Persuader: You can go to the website I provided you earlier to know in your heart that this is not a scam.
Persuader: Can I count on you to help these children?
Persuader: Are you willing to trust me enough to donate your task payment to help these children?
Persuadee: I do not know in my heart that this is not a scam.
Persuadee: I have been scammed before.
Persuadee: That is why i am asking you for the details.
Persuadee: Againwhat  roughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?
Persuader: I went to the website and looked up the actual numbers.
Persuader: 86.5% of donations goes directly to the villages and the rest goes to fund the outreach, website, and publicity. it is a non-profit organization. You don't have to donate the entire amount of your task payment. you can choose any amount from nothing to the $2. I am just hoping you would be gracious to help these children enough to give the $2 and give them a fighting chance. I really believe you know this isn't a scam
Persuadee: How do you donate?
Persuader: This chat is being recorded, you Tell me how much you would like to donate and I will give it to the research team for them to deduct it from your task payment and send it to Save the Children.
Persuader: How much would you like to donate today?
Persuadee: I am still not 100% confident this isn't a scam as it is all done via the computer and not face to face.
Persuader: Would you like to take a few minutes to go over the website first before you commit?",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Emotional,Yes,Yes,Yes,Concrete,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes

Persuadee: Hi
Persuader: How much do you know about Save the Children?
Persuadee: I know that it is a charity.
Persuadee: I think I have seen some commercials for it in my lifetime.
Persuader: Were you aware that Save the Children assists both children in the U.S. as well as foreign countries?
Persuadee: No.
Persuadee: I figured they just tried to help children in under developed countries.
Persuadee: That's great that they help people in the U.S. as well!
Persuadee: I think it's important to help children from our country and also others.
Persuader: Yes, not only do we help out with literacy and school related causes, but also with feeding, shelter, and disaster relief for children all over the world.
Persuadee: That's wonderful!
Persuadee: Are you a top rated charity?
Persuadee: How much goes to administrative costs?
Persuader: We are a top rated charity, and have been around for nearly 100 years!
Persuader: Nearly 90% of our funds go straight to children, with the remainder going to fundraising costs and only 5% for admin costs.
Persuadee: Wow!  That's really great!
Persuadee: I've seen companies go to 70% and I can't help but judge them for it.
Persuadee: I think this is a fair percentage to have.
Persuader: We try our best to keep the children first, and have done so in aiding millions of children over the years.
Persuadee: I think that's great!
Persuadee: What country is in the most need right now?
Persuader: Both Africa and USA currently have the highest number of children in need.
Persuadee: That's sad that a country as powerful as the USA still has problems with children in need.
Persuader: It is very sad, but with the help of so many millions of caring people we are able to enrich the lives of so many.
Persuadee: What is the money used for mostly?  Food?  Toys?  Clothes?
Persuadee: I think this is all very interesting stuff.
Persuadee: I've never had the chance to talk to a charity before.
Persuader: Monies go to sustain the lives of children in environments in which basic necessities are lacking.
Persuader: For example,Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuadee: That's terrible.
Persuadee: I hope this kind of environment changes for them.
Persuadee: Children deserve to be in a safe place and to feel secure.
Persuader: Well, each day children are able to get such needs met by the generosity of those even with donations as small as the cost of about $1 a day.
Persuader: A little goes such a long way!
Persuadee: I can imagine!
Persuadee: I hope lots of people donate to you.

Persuader: I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?
Persuadee: I guess I could throw them .10
Persuader: Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?
Persuadee: I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.
Persuader: It wouldn't hurt to give more.
Persuader: Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.
Persuader: You know they're worse off than you, right?
Persuadee: Honestly < do not think so.
Persuadee: My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..
Persuadee: To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.
Persuader: These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.
Persuader: Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?
Persuadee: 0k Here is a .25
Persuader: Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?
Persuadee: I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…
Persuadee: Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..
Persuader: This isn\'t money you\'ve even seen yet though.
Persuader: It\'s ""imaginary"" money until it materializes so that\'s different?
Persuader: I\'m sure you could give $2
Persuadee: Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.
Persuader: Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?
Persuader: $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.
Persuadee: No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.
Persuadee: shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.
Persuader: Then why not give some money to these kids too?

20180903-111245_955_live,"Persuader: Hello, have you heard of Save The Children?
Persuadee: I think so, it sounds familiar.
Persuadee: it is a nonprofit charity if i recall.
Persuadee: What exactly do they do?
Persuader: Save The Children helps kids from around the world by taking contributions from generous patrons. Kids from countries that have been stricken by poverty, violence, and other blights.
Persuadee: What countries has the charity worked in recently?
Persuader: Well, we have programs set up in 120 countries in total right now.
Persuader: Some of our most recent campaigns involve Myanmar - in Rohingya where parents and their children have been forced to flee because of violence to surrounding countries. In the largest refugee camp stationed in Bangladesh, there are an estimated 915,000 children and adults taking shelter.
Persuadee: Wow that sounds like a really robust program.
Persuadee: How long has Save the Children been around?
Persuader: It was founded in 1919, on April 15th in London - UK.
Persuadee: Do you work for Save the Children or do you just volunteer for the charity?
Persuader: I do not work for them, I work on behalf of them.
Persuader: That is why I'm talking to you today.
Persuader: These children need help, and could use it from generous people like you.
Persuader: A meal, an education, an opportunity like everyone else, that is all these kids want.
Persuader: Even one cent will add up to help a child in need, but if you wish you may donate up to 2 dollars.
Persuader: For every cent you donate it will come directly from your task payment.
Persuadee: I love to help charities that serve a good cause and I would love to donate but I do have one question.
Persuadee: What is the portion of donations that goes to children versus the portion that goes to administration or other expenses
Persuader: Sure, absolutely. In 2017, 86% went to Program services - or services that directly help aid these children. 9% went towards fundraising efforts, and 5% went towards our Management & other general costs. In 2018 we anticipate similar numbers.
Persuadee: That's pretty impressive!
Persuadee: Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.
Persuader: We do it for them, not for ourselves.
Persuader: And we hope our numbers reflect that amount of love and effort that goes toward what we do.
Persuadee: I'd be willing to donate $1 to Save the Children.
Persuader: That is very kind!
Persuader: After this chat is complete, you may choose how ever much you wish to give on the next page.
Persuader: Would you like to know about a potential child this money would be helping?
Persuadee: Sure, tell me more about a potential child this money would help.
Persuader: Mim, in Bangladesh is 7 years old, and wants to become a teacher.
Persuader: It could go towards her education, because in her country the average girl only stays in school until 10 years old.
Persuader: But more likely, it will be going towards meals or daily living expenses, with the average parent from her country only earning $3 a day.
Persuadee: How much does a $1 dollar donation change a child like Mim's situation?
Persuader: As you can see, $1 will change their world.
Persuader: One more meal or a pair of shoes will be one less thing that Mim, and her parents need to worry about.
Persuader: Bangladesh has been one of the largest parts of that Rohingya refugee exodus from Myanmar that I mentioned before and have been struggling themselves taking on more than 655,000 extra people.
Persuader: This has caused further hardship on an already hardened country.
Persuadee: Besides donating and raising awareness, is there any other way I can help Save the Children?
Persuader: Yes.
Persuader: You can slo sign up & stay connected on our website with your email and phone number.
Persuader: You can also volunteer if you're in the area of any of these children at our program centers.

Persuader: I'm excited to tell you about it! it is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: In what way does it support children?
Persuader: There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.
Persuader: For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.
Persuader: In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
Persuadee: I see so does the money go for food, shelter, medical support those kinds of things?
Persuader: exactly.
Persuader: The war torn area is just one of many examples of places where kids need support.
Persuader: It's great to help.
Persuader: every little bit counts!
Persuadee: Does this money provide help for the kids in their own country or is it used to bring these children over to the United States?
Persuader: to help in their countries.
Persuader: They also help kids here in the USA too.

Persuader: Of course you can donate to other charities.
Persuader: It's not necessarily a zero-sum game.
Persuader: I can tell you, however, that Save the Children is, in a way, more immediate in helping people (as opposed to fighting disease like St Jude's) and delivers services similar to the Red Cross, but directed toward children.
Persuader: So, please: think of the children!
Persuadee: Do they help kids in the US?
Persuadee: I like to help people that are close to home.
Persuader: Their assistance is directed toward children in developing countries, where, unlike most of the US, children are totally deprived of opportunity and basic services.
Persuader: Though you, being the generous person you are, like helping those at home, is there a reason not to help children abroad?
Persuadee: I don't mind helping those abroad.
Persuadee: But there are a lot kids here in the US who deal with poverty.
Persuadee: So it's not that I don't care about the children elsewhere, just want to help those at home first.
Persuader: So we'll agree then: you can do both!
Persuadee: Well how do i make a donation to them?
Persuader: You can refer to Save the Children's website to gather more information if you like to: http:// URL

Persuader: They promote children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.
Persuadee: That sounds like a very nice cause.
Persuader: Yes, it\'s a great cause.
Persuader: And the charity is highly rated with many positive rewards.
Persuader: Including an ""A"" rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy.
Persuadee: That's awesome!
Persuadee: Do you know when the charity began?
Persuader: It was founded way back on April 15, 1919!
Persuader: A charity with that kind of history shows that it has made an amazing impact.
Persuader: Just last year they helped a total of 155 million children!
Persuadee: That is very impressive.
Persuadee: Do you know on average how much money the charity makes per year?
Persuader: The total operating revenue was $807,412 in 2017, and 9 out of every 10  dollars they make goes straight into the programs and services to help children and families in need.
Persuadee: That is awesome.
Persuader: I know I was surprised by those numbers.
Persuader: A lot of widely known charities aren't as open and honest about where their finances go, but you can easily find Save the Children's financial reports online.
Persuader: That's important to me in a charity.
Persuadee: Yes, definitely.
Persuadee: Unfortunately some ""charities"" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.
Persuader: That's the truth.
Persuader: That's why it's so important to do research before donating.
Persuader: Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.
Persuader: For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.
Persuader: It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.
Persuader: Super helpful.
Persuadee: That's very helpful.
Persuadee: It is best to be transparent when running a charity like that, especially when the charity brings in a large amount of money.
Persuadee: That way nobody can question anything.
Persuader: Oh yeah.
Persuader: When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.
Persuader: Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs!
Persuader: The rest goes to ""fundraising, management, and general"" as the website says.
Persuader: That\'s good to hear that it\'s not all about filling some people\'s pockets.
Persuadee: Right.
Persuadee: I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.
Persuader: Exactly.
Persuader: It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.
Persuader: I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.
Persuader: Have you ever donated to charity in the past?
Persuadee: Yes I have.
Persuadee: I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child.
Persuadee: The people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.
Persuader: That is so special.
Persuader: That must be an amazing feeling to be able to give back.
Persuader: How do you feel about donating to Save the Children?
Persuader: You can choose an amount that would be taken out automatically from your reward from this task.
Persuader: You can pick any amount from $0 to $2.
Persuader: I know that any small donation counts, because the more individuals donate the more impact they can make.
Persuadee: Sure, I'd be glad to donate $0.25 to Save the Children.

Persuader: Efforts Focus on Restoring and Improving Early Learning and Education Programs, Helping Children Emotionally Heal, Building Resilience, Preparing for Next Emergency
Persuadee: How do they do that?
Persuader: By people like you, making a a donation of just $1 a day, you can feed a child for a month.
Persuadee: The exchange rate must be pretty good.
Persuadee: How do they ensure that the money is effective in feeding the children and not lining pockets?
Persuader: In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services.
Persuadee: How do they define ""Program services"", and do they have independent verification of those findings?
Persuader: They help to feed, house and educate children all around the world.
Persuadee: That really isn't an answer to the previous question, though
Persuader: You can find reports associated with the financial information by visiting this link:  URL s/about-us/resource-library
Persuadee: That is a solid informational link, including a full board of trustees to look into.
Persuadee: What about controveries in 2009 regarding parents in Britain?
Persuader: I believe this is still under investigation.
Persuadee: Should have went for deflection or dismissal.
Persuadee: Works better on skeptics.
Persuadee: Ditto for their problems with the energy company in 2013.
Persuadee: Although that one is easier to spin as seeking more money to fund more projects.
Persuadee: You could also mention their rating from the BBB.
Persuader: So are you willing to donate 10 cents today, this money can go to helping children who have grown up with the threat of violence and starvation all of their lives.
Persuadee: I'll donate 10 cents.
Persuader: Cool thank you.
Persuader: Together, we're changing children's lives and the future we all share.
Persuadee: I'm not certain if that's scripted or not but if it isn't there's a better way to word that and if it is I think the person who wrote it might need to retire because they clearly come from the 50s.

Persuader: Save the Children promotes children's rights, and helps children from developing countries.
Persuadee: What types of children's rights?
Persuader: Your donation would help ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.

Persuader: Save the Children has excellent credentials and is managed by a board of commercial CEOs and business leaders without any government or religious affiliation.
Persuadee: Does Save the Children help children in the United States?
Persuader: Yes!
Persuader: Since 1932, Save the Children has been on the ground providing support to the most isolated and underserved children in rural America.
Persuader: Many of these children don't have the same opportunities as others and live in very difficult conditions.
Persuadee: That is awesome.
Persuadee: I work hard to help children as well.

Persuader: Even a small donation can have a large impact in impoverished areas.
Persuadee: I am curious why you chose the words ""rural America""?
Persuader: Of course.
Persuader: I chose those words because across the United States, one in five children grows up in poverty and, of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural.
Persuader: Because of circumstances beyond their control, millions of kids never reach their full potential.
Persuadee: mmmm that is interesting, I did not know that statistic.
Persuadee: I work with children more in an ""urban"" setting that are incredibly in bad circumstances.
Persuader: I agree that children in both settings need help and commend you for your efforts.
